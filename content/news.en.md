## New training times for the cold part of the year

Starting from October, we're switching to weekend training.
Sunset is becoming too early for week night training.
We'll be meeting every Sunday at 12 noon,
at our regular training ground, the Nordmarksportfeld.
During the week we'll be meeting up for other sports activities
in smaller groups.
