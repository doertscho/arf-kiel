## We're back to the training ground! 

Starting from the 17th May 2021,
we'll be able to return to training.
From this day on,
the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein will lift restrictions
so that contact sport will be allowed in groups of up to ten.
Depending on turnout, we'll split up into multiple groups.
Get in touch if you're interested in joining us!
We can't wait to get back after such a long break,
and we're probably not alone.
