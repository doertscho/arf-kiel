# Our training sessions in Kiel

During summer time, we'll meet for training every **Monday and Wednesday from 6pm**.
Starting from October 13, 2024, we'll switch to **Sundays at 11am**.
Our training ground is the Nordmarksportfeld public sports ground,
close to Kiel university.
Contact us any time,
or just come around to one of the training sessions!

## Open for all!

Everybody is welcome to join the training!
Most of us are absolute beginners,
and we'll always design the exercises in such a way
that everyone can participate,
regardless of their individual level.
You don't really need to bring anything,
but ideally you should have a pair of shoes that work well on grass,
like football boots with rubber studs.

Please note that we do not have access
to the changing rooms and showers at the ground
on a regular basis.
