# Our training sessions in Kiel

During the cold part of the year (since October),
we'll be training every **Sunday from 12 noon**.
Our training ground is the Nordmarksportfeld public sports ground,
close to Kiel university.

## Open for all!

Everybody is welcome to join the training!
Most of us are absolute beginners,
and we'll always design the exercises in such a way
that everyone can participate,
regardless of their individual level.
You don't really need to bring anything,
but ideally you should have a pair of shoes that work well on grass,
like football boots with rubber studs.

Please note that at the moment,
the changing rooms, showers and toilets at the ground
are not available on a regular basis.
