# Our training sessions in Kiel

During winter time, we'll meet for training every **Sunday from 2pm**.
Our training ground is the Nordmarksportfeld public sports ground,
close to Kiel university.
To be on the safe side, get in touch with us beforehand,
as it may well be that some training sessions are cancelled
due to bad weather or other reasons.

## Open for all!

Everybody is welcome to join the training!
Most of us are absolute beginners,
and we'll always design the exercises in such a way
that everyone can participate,
regardless of their individual level.
You don't really need to bring anything,
but ideally you should have a pair of shoes that work well on grass,
like football boots with rubber studs.

Please note that at the moment,
the changing rooms, showers and toilets at the ground
are not available on a regular basis.
