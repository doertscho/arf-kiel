# Our training sessions in Kiel

{{< next-sessions >}}

Our session started later than we had hoped,
due to the safety restrictions.
But finally, we could get going â€“ Aussie Rules has made its way to Kiel!
We held our first session on 20th May.
There are still some limitations, 
and we can't practise all aspects of the sport yet,
but there are many things that are very much compatible with safety distances.

Our sessions are currently happening each week on Wednesday, 6pm.
If that date doesn't work for you,
please get in touch and we'll consider your preferences in our planning.

Everybody is welcome to join the training!
Most of us are absolute beginners,
and we'll always design the exercises in such a way
that everyone can participate,
regardless of their individual level.
You don't really need to bring anything,
but ideally you should have a pair of shoes that work well on grass,
like football boots with rubber studs.

Our sessions take place at Nordmarksportfeld,
close to Kiel university.
Please note that the changing facilities are still not opened for the time being.
