# Our training sessions in Kiel

**Please note: There's thunderstorms predicted for Monday, the 17th August.
Please check our channels, we may cancel training on that day.**

Our sessions take place every Monday and Wednesday from 6pm.
If those days doesn't work for you,
please get in touch anyway
and we'll try to consider your preferences in our planning.

Everybody is welcome to join the training!
Most of us are absolute beginners,
and we'll always design the exercises in such a way
that everyone can participate,
regardless of their individual level.
You don't really need to bring anything,
but ideally you should have a pair of shoes that work well on grass,
like football boots with rubber studs.

Our training ground is the Nordmarksportfeld public sports ground,
close to Kiel university.
