# Our training sessions in Kiel

Training will be back on Monday, 17th of May 2021!
From this day on,
the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein will lift restrictions
so that contact sport will be allowed in groups of up to ten.
Depending on turnout, we'll split up into multiple groups.

We'll be training every **Monday and Wednesday from 6pm**.
Our training ground is the Nordmarksportfeld public sports ground,
close to Kiel university.

## Notes regarding safety

We are confident that it is safe to go ahead with our training.
We gather outdoors on a large, open sports ground.
It is in the nature of our sport that for most drills,
there will be more than the required safety distance.
We'll be collecting contact details of all participants,
and we ask everyone to get tested before the training.

## Open for all!

Everybody is welcome to join the training!
Most of us are absolute beginners,
and we'll always design the exercises in such a way
that everyone can participate,
regardless of their individual level.
You don't really need to bring anything,
but ideally you should have a pair of shoes that work well on grass,
like football boots with rubber studs.

Please note that at the moment,
the changing rooms, showers and toilets at the ground
can not yet be used.
