# Aussie Rules is coming to Kiel!

Australian Rules Football is a fast and action-packed sport,
and the most popular one in its native country.
In Germany, however, it is barely known so far,
and there was no club in Kiel either.
We want to change that!
We believe that this great game deserves more attention outside Australia too.

We're inviting everyone to join us and give it a try.
Regardless of whether you know the sport or want to try something new, 
and no matter your gender, age, height, shape or whatever. 
Aussie Rules is such a multi-faceted sport that there's a place for anyone, 
no matter what your individual strengths are.
More info about the game: [About ARF]({{< relref "about-arf" >}})

We recently started our regular training sessions,
which take place at Nordmarksportfeld.
Fun always comes first, and there's no obligations whatsoever when you join a session.
We teach all the basics of the game to beginners 
and practise the various different skills that make the sport.

Want to give it a try? Great! 
In that case, we want to hear from you.
Get in touch via the following means –
or just pop around to one of the next training sessions.

And by the way:
Going forward, we'd love to start an official club
and put Kiel on the map of the German league, 
the [AFL Germany](http://www.aflg.de/).
There will also be social events for anyone who's in the mood – 
like screenings of matches from the Australian professional league, the AFL.
