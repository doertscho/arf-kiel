# Aussie Rules is coming to Kiel!

Want to try a new sport and make new friends? Great!
Ever heard of Australian Football? No?
That's no problem at all – you're certainly not alone.
(If you HAVE heard of that sport,
maybe you're an Aussie far away from home,
missing a kick of the footy –
you are just as welcome to join us of course,
and we can probably learn a lot from you!)

Australian Rules Football is a fast and action-packed sport,
and the most popular one in its native country.
In Germany, however, it is barely known so far,
and there was no club in Kiel either.
We want to change that!
We believe that this great game deserves more attention outside Australia too.

Regardless of whether you know the sport or want to try something new,
and no matter your gender, age, height, shape or whatever.
Aussie Rules is such a multi-faceted sport that there's a place for anyone,
no matter what your individual strengths are.
More info about the game: [About AF]({{< relref "about-arf" >}})

We're building up Kiel's first Australian Football club,
and we're inviting all of you to join us!
It's something new for most of us,
and training is always beginner-friendly.
Give it a try – and if you like it, become part of our team
and represent Kiel in the German league!

We meet every Monday and Wednesday from 6pm
at the Nordmarksportfeld public sports ground, close to Kiel university.
Fun always comes first,
and there's no obligations whatsoever when you join a session.
We teach all the basics of the game to beginners
and practise the various different skills that make the sport.
Find more details and updates at short notice here:

Curious? Great!
In that case, we want to hear from you.
Get in touch via the following means –
or just pop around to one of the next training sessions.

And by the way:
We're currently preparing the stuff we need
to become an officially registered club.
And starting from next year,
the Kiel Koalas Australian Football Club
will be part of the [AFL Germany](http://www.aflg.de/)
and represent Kiel in the German league.
Stay tuned!
If you're interested in supporting this endeavour,
building up the club, promoting the sport in Kiel,
and getting to know the Australian Football community in Germany –
get in touch, we appreciate any support!
