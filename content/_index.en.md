## We're looking for new Koalas.

**We're inviting you all to get to know our sport: Australian Football.
Never heard of it before? Don't worry, you're certainly not alone.**

In its native country, Australian Football is the number one spectator sport.
The professional league, the AFL,
is one of the five most-attended sports leagues in the world.
In Germany, however, barely anyone knows the sport.
We want to change that!

## What's it all about?

Australian Football is a fast and action-packed sport
in which there is a role for everyone,
no matter your gender, age, height, shape or whatever.
Good teamwork is absolutely mandatory.
And it's simply great fun to play and to watch.
